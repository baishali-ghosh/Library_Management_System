A sample library management application that aims to simulate the borrowing and renewal of library books via a Django web application.  

For the database, I have used Oracle 11g but you may use MySQL, PostGRE SQL or anything else that you prefer.
To establish the connection to your database, go to the settings.py file located at miniproj/miniproj/settings.py and make appropriate changes in the DATABASES section. For more details on how to do this, please read the section on database configuration in Django's docs.
